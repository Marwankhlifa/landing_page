# Landing Page Project
hello there, its my first project including javaScript and i hope it goes well.

I faced many obstacles during my journey to implement this project, and with research and perseverance, I managed to overcome them, so I apologize for the delay in delivering the project on time.

## Table of Contents
HTML
CSS
JAVASCRIPT


## Hints
Sometimes I can't deliver projects on time because I have a problem with concentrating for long periods of time because I have multiple sclerosis and that hinders me a bit and that makes me suspicious of being revoked in completing that track,I just wish I could take into account that point.


## Instructions
I searched many sites that really helped me to complete my project, including the following:
